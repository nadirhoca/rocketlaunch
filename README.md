🚀 Rocket Launch Animation

A web-based simulation of a rocket launch featuring procedural particle effects, dynamic CSS animations, and a mission control telemetry dashboard.

✨ Features

Procedural Background: Dynamic star field with twinkling effects.

Physics Simulation: basic physics for velocity and acceleration calculation during ascent.

Particle System: HTML5 Canvas-based engine for rendering smoke, fire, and sparks during ignition and liftoff.

Mission Control: Real-time dashboard showing status, altitude, velocity, and thrust.

Visual Effects: Screen shake during high-thrust phases and dynamic lighting.

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5: Structure and layout.

CSS3: Styling, gradients, and keyframe animations for the rocket body and UI.

JavaScript (ES6+): Logic for the game loop, physics calculations, and particle rendering.

Canvas API: High-performance rendering for exhaust plumes.

👨‍🍳 Origin Story

This project was cooked using Antigravity with Opus 4.5 thinking.

🎮 Controls

LAUNCH: Initiates the countdown sequence, followed by ignition and liftoff.

RESET: Aborts the simulation and resets the rocket to the launchpad.
